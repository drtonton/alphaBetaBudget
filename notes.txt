alpha static:
	430 - rent
	75 - gym
	40 - citi (credit card)
	90 - verizon (phone)
	145 - chase (student loan)
	---
	780 - total

beta static:
	380 - uas ( student loan)
	40 - geico (car ins.)
	185 - navient (student loan) 
	---
	605 - total

pay per period: 1430

alpha left after static (call this "a"): 650
	
beta/left after static (call this "b"): 825

dynamic expenditures (monthly):
	200 - gas
	400 - food
	200 - fun/extra
	150 - utils/house
	---
	950 / 475 (d) - monthly/period need for dynamics

a(650) - d(475) = 175 (call this "savedA") - put this amount to savings or a debt
b(825) - d(475) = 350 (call this "savedB") - put this amount to savings or a debt

variables to track:
	- whats left for gas (after each gas expenditure)
	- whats left for food (after each food expenditure)
	- whats left for fun (after each silly expenditure)
	- money unspent end of period (grow checking acct? or allocate to save/debt? not sure. growing checking slowly would be smart to prep for emergency situations)
	- money unspent end of month (same ? as above)
	- variation of checking balance after month (to track growth)
	- what acct balance should be (this ones vital... check about querying wells fargo api for balance)
	- debt balances (to track)
	

Design Ideas & Notes:
	1. use the raw_input capability in Python to capture spending inputs
	2. make this a terminal application
	3. 3 ** 2 equals 3^2 in python
